# Contributing to Tractatus Framework

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this research project!

## Important Context

This repository contains **early research** (Working Paper v0.1) from a single deployment context. Contributions that help validate, extend, or improve these patterns are welcome.

---

## How to Contribute

### 1. Replication Studies

**Most Valuable**: Test these patterns in your own context and report results.

**What to include**:
- Your deployment context (AI system, project type, duration)
- Which patterns you tested
- What worked / didn't work
- Metrics (with sources)
- Honest limitations

**Format**: Open an issue titled "Replication Study: [Your Context]"

### 2. Pattern Improvements

Suggest enhancements to existing generic patterns.

**Guidelines**:
- Keep patterns generic (no project-specific code)
- Explain the improvement rationale
- Provide example usage
- Document any new limitations

### 3. New Patterns

Share architectural governance patterns you've discovered.

**Requirements**:
- Generic pattern (not production code)
- Clear documentation
- Example usage
- Honest assessment of limitations
- Apache 2.0 compatible

### 4. Bug Reports

Found issues in code examples or documentation?

**Include**:
- Which file has the issue
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Suggested fix (optional)

### 5. Documentation Improvements

Help clarify, correct, or expand documentation.

**Areas welcome**:
- Typo fixes
- Clarity improvements
- Additional examples
- Translation (if approved first)

## Contribution Process

### Step 1: Check Existing Issues

Search existing issues/discussions to avoid duplicates.

### Step 2: Open an Issue First

For significant changes, open an issue to discuss before coding.

### Step 3: Fork & Create Branch

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tractatus-framework.git
cd tractatus-framework
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### Step 4: Make Changes

- Follow existing code style
- Keep patterns generic
- Add comments explaining approach
- Update documentation

### Step 5: Test

- Test code examples work as documented
- Verify diagrams render correctly
- Check links are not broken

### Step 6: Commit

Use clear commit messages:

```
type: brief description

- Detailed change 1
- Detailed change 2

Rationale: why this change is needed
```

Types: `docs`, `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`

### Step 7: Push & Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Open PR with:
- Clear title
- Description of changes
- Why the change is needed
- Any limitations of the approach

### Step 8: Respond to Feedback

- Address review comments
- Update PR as needed
- Be open to suggestions

## What We're Looking For

### High Priority

1. **Replication studies** in different contexts
2. **Validation research** testing effectiveness claims
3. **Pattern improvements** based on real-world use
4. **Limitation documentation** - what doesn't work

### Medium Priority

5. **Documentation clarity** improvements
6. **Example enhancements** (more educational value)
7. **Diagram additions** (new visualizations)

### Low Priority

8. **Typo fixes** (always welcome, but minor)
9. **Style improvements** (must preserve clarity)

---

## What We're NOT Looking For

❌ **Production code** - This is a research repository
❌ **Project-specific implementations** - Keep patterns generic
❌ **Overclaims** - No "production-ready" or "proven effective" without evidence
❌ **Sales pitches** - This is academic/research work
❌ **Breaking changes** - Maintain backward compatibility
