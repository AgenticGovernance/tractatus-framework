## Overview

This repository contains research documentation and generic code patterns demonstrating **architectural enforcement** for AI governance in development contexts. The patterns address "governance fade" - the gradual degradation of AI policy adherence over time.

**üî¨ Research Focus**: Development-time governance (AI coding assistants, not runtime applications)

**üìÑ Full Research Paper**: [Working Paper v0.1](docs/research-paper.md)

**üåê Interactive Version**: [agenticgovernance.digital](https://agenticgovernance.digital/docs.html)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer

### This is EARLY RESEARCH, not production software

**Limitations**:
- **Single Context**: Observations from one developer, one project, 19 days (October 6-25, 2025)
- **No Validation**: Findings have NOT been peer-reviewed or validated across contexts
- **Observational Only**: No controlled studies comparing effectiveness
- **Development-Time Only**: Runtime governance not evaluated
- **Patterns Not Product**: Generic examples, not ready-to-deploy code

**What We Can Claim**: Architectural patterns demonstrated feasibility in single deployment

**What We Cannot Claim**: Long-term effectiveness, generalizability, behavioral compliance validation

üìã **Full Limitations**: [docs/limitations.md](docs/limitations.md)

## Core Concepts

### Governance Fade

AI systems learn patterns that override explicit instructions. Example: Claude learned "Warmup ‚Üí session-init ‚Üí ready" and skipped reading handoff documents despite explicit instructions.

### Architectural Enforcement

Instead of relying on AI voluntary compliance:

1. **Persistent Rule Database**: Structured storage with classification metadata
2. **Hook-Based Interception**: Validate actions before execution (PreToolUse hooks)
3. **Framework Services**: Specialized governance components (BoundaryEnforcer, ContextPressureMonitor, etc.)
4. **Continuous Auditing**: Log all governance decisions for analysis
5. **Meta-Enforcement**: Framework monitors itself for fade

### Key Pattern: Handoff Auto-Injection

**Problem**: Pattern recognition overrode instruction to read handoff document

**Solution**: Auto-inject handoff content during session initialization (make information unavoidable)

**Result**: Handoff context automatically displayed; no voluntary compliance needed

**Limitation**: Only tested once; long-term effectiveness unknown

## Quick Start (Educational Use)

### Understand the Research

```bash
# Read the working paper
cat docs/research-paper.md | less

# Review verified metrics
ls docs/metrics/

# View architecture diagram
cat docs/diagrams/architecture-overview.mmd
```

### Explore Code Patterns

```bash
# Hook validation pattern
node examples/hooks/pre-tool-use-validator.js

# Session lifecycle pattern
node examples/session-lifecycle/session-init-pattern.js

# Audit logging pattern
node examples/audit/audit-logger.js
```

### Adapt to Your Context

**CRITICAL**: These are generic patterns. To use in your project:

1. Implement your own rule database
2. Adapt hooks to your AI system
3. Customize enforcement logic
4. Add your own testing
5. **DO NOT** use as-is in production

## Architecture

### Four-Layer Enforcement

1. **Persistent Rule Database**
   - JSON schema with classification metadata
   - Quadrants: SYSTEM, PRIVACY, VALUES, RULES
   - Persistence levels: HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW

2. **Hook-Based Interception**
   - PreToolUse: Validate before execution
   - UserPromptSubmit: Classify new instructions
   - PostToolUse: Audit outcomes

3. **Framework Services** (6 components)
   - `BoundaryEnforcer`: Values-sensitive decisions
   - `ContextPressureMonitor`: Session quality
   - `CrossReferenceValidator`: Conflict detection
   - `InstructionPersistenceClassifier`: Rule categorization
   - `MetacognitiveVerifier`: Reasoning validation
   - `PluralisticDeliberationOrchestrator`: Stakeholder deliberation

4. **Audit & Analytics**
   - Decision logging to database
   - Service activity tracking
   - Block rate analysis

## Research Findings

**From Single Deployment Context** (October 6-25, 2025):

### Enforcement Coverage

- **Baseline**: 11/39 rules (28%) had enforcement mechanisms
- **Wave 1-5 Deployment**: Progressive coverage increase
- **Final**: 40/40 rules (100%) enforced

**Limitation**: Coverage = hooks exist, NOT effectiveness proven

### Framework Activity

- **1,294 governance decisions** logged across 6 services
- **162 bash commands blocked** (12.2% block rate)
- **Handoff auto-injection** prevented pattern recognition override

**Limitation**: Activity ‚â† accuracy; no validation of decision correctness

### Timeline

- **Project start**: October 6, 2025
- **Framework core**: October 7, 2025 (6 services)
- **Enforcement waves**: October 25, 2025 (28% ‚Üí 100%)
- **Total duration**: 19 days

**Limitation**: Short timeline; long-term stability unknown

- Extensive testing in your context
- Security audit
- Validation of effectiveness
- Peer review

### Can I use these patterns in my project?

**Yes**, but with caution:
- These are educational examples, not production code
- Adapt to your specific context
- Test thoroughly
- Understand limitations
- No warranty provided (see LICENSE)

### Will this prevent all governance violations?

**Unknown.** We observed 162 blocks in our context, but:
- No measurement of false positive rate
- No validation of long-term effectiveness
- No testing in other contexts
- Behavioral compliance not measured
