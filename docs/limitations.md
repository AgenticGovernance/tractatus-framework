**Purpose**: Document what we CAN and CANNOT claim in Working Paper v0.1
**Date**: 2025-10-25

## ✅ WHAT WE CAN CLAIM (With Verified Sources)

### Enforcement Coverage

**Claim**: "Achieved 100% enforcement coverage (40/40 imperative instructions) through 5-wave deployment"

**Evidence**:
- Source: `node scripts/audit-enforcement.js` (verified 2025-10-25)
- Wave progression documented in git commits (08cbb4f → 696d452)
- Timeline: All waves deployed October 25, 2025 (single day)

**Limitations**:
- Coverage measures existence of enforcement mechanisms, NOT effectiveness
- No measurement of whether hooks/scripts actually prevent violations
- No false positive rate data
- Short timeline (1 day) = limited evidence of stability

---

### Framework Activity

**Claim**: "Framework logged 1,266+ governance decisions across 6 services during development"

**Evidence**:
- Source: MongoDB audit logs (`mongosh tractatus_dev --eval "db.auditLogs.countDocuments()"`)
- Service breakdown verified via aggregation query
- BashCommandValidator issued 162 blocks (12.2% block rate)

**Limitations**:
- Activity ≠ accuracy (no measurement of decision correctness)
- No user satisfaction metrics
- No A/B comparison (no control group without framework)
- Session-scoped data (not longitudinal across multiple sessions)

---

### Real-World Enforcement

**Claim**: "Framework blocked 162 unsafe bash commands and prevented credential exposure during development"

**Evidence**:
- Source: `node scripts/framework-stats.js`
- Documented examples: Prohibited term block (pre-commit hook), dev server kill prevention
- Defense-in-Depth: 5/5 layers verified complete

**Limitations**:
- Cannot count historical credential blocks (no exposure = no logs)
- No measurement of attacks prevented (preventive, not reactive)
- False positive rate unknown
- Limited to development environment (not production runtime)

---

### Development Timeline

**Claim**: "Developed core framework (6 services) in 2 days, achieved 100% enforcement in 19 days total"

**Evidence**:
- Source: Git commit history (Oct 6-25, 2025)
- Wave deployment intervals documented
- Commit hashes verified

**Limitations**:
- Rapid development = potential for undiscovered issues
- Short timeline = limited evidence of long-term stability
- Single developer context = generalizability unknown
- No peer review yet (Working Paper stage)

---

### Session Lifecycle

**Claim**: "Implemented architectural enforcement (inst_083) to prevent handoff document skipping via auto-injection"

**Evidence**:
- Source: scripts/session-init.js (Section 1a)
- Tested this session: handoff context auto-displayed
- Addresses observed failure pattern (27027-style)

**Limitations**:
- Only tested in one session post-implementation
- No measurement of whether this improves long-term continuity
- Architectural solution untested across multiple compaction cycles

---

## ❌ WHAT WE CANNOT CLAIM (And Why)

### Long-Term Effectiveness

**Cannot Claim**: "Framework prevents governance fade over extended periods"

**Why Not**:
- Project timeline: 19 days total (Oct 6-25, 2025)
- No longitudinal data beyond single session
- No evidence of performance across weeks/months

**What We Can Say Instead**: "Framework designed to prevent governance fade through architectural enforcement; long-term effectiveness validation ongoing"

---

### Production Readiness

**Cannot Claim**: "Framework is production-ready" or "Framework is deployment-ready" (inst_018 violation)

**Why Not**:
- Development-time governance only (not runtime)
- No production deployment testing
- No security audit
- No peer review
- Working Paper stage = validation ongoing

**What We Can Say Instead**: "Framework demonstrates development-time governance patterns; production deployment considerations documented in limitations"

---

### Generalizability

**Cannot Claim**: "Framework works for all development contexts"

**Why Not**:
- Single developer (John G Stroh)
- Single project (Tractatus)
- Single AI system (Claude Code)
- No testing with other developers, projects, or AI systems

**What We Can Say Instead**: "Framework developed and tested in single-developer context with Claude Code; generalizability to other contexts requires validation"

---

### Accuracy/Correctness

**Cannot Claim**: "Framework makes correct governance decisions"

**Why Not**:
- No measurement of decision accuracy
- No gold standard comparison
- No user satisfaction data
- No false positive/negative rates

**What We Can Say Instead**: "Framework logged 1,266+ governance decisions; decision quality assessment pending user study and peer review"

---

### Behavioral Compliance

**Cannot Claim**: "Framework ensures Claude follows all instructions"

**Why Not**:
- Enforcement coverage measures mechanisms, not behavior
- No systematic testing of voluntary compliance vs. enforcement
- Handoff auto-injection is new (inst_083), only tested once

**What We Can Say Instead**: "Framework provides architectural enforcement for 40/40 imperative instructions; behavioral compliance validation ongoing"

---

### Attack Prevention

**Cannot Claim**: "Framework prevented X credential exposures" or "Framework stopped Y attacks"

**Why Not**:
- Defense-in-Depth works preventively (no exposure = no logs)
- Cannot count events that didn't happen
- No controlled testing with intentional attacks

**What We Can Say Instead**: "Framework implements 5-layer defense-in-depth; no credential exposures occurred during development period (Oct 6-25, 2025)"

---

### Cost-Benefit

**Cannot Claim**: "Framework improves development efficiency" or "Framework reduces security incidents"

**Why Not**:
- No before/after comparison
- No control group
- No incident rate data
- No developer productivity metrics

**What We Can Say Instead**: "Framework adds governance overhead; efficiency and security impact assessment pending comparative study"

## 🔬 UNCERTAINTY ESTIMATES

### High Confidence (>90%)

- Enforcement coverage: 40/40 (100%) - verified via audit script
- Framework activity: 1,266+ logs - verified via MongoDB query
- Bash command blocks: 162 - verified via framework stats
- Timeline: Oct 6-25, 2025 - verified via git history
- Defense-in-Depth: 5/5 layers - verified via audit script

### Medium Confidence (50-90%)

- Block rate calculation (12.2%) - depends on validation count accuracy
- Wave progression timeline - commit timestamps approximate
- Session handoff count (8) - depends on file naming pattern
- Framework fade detection - depends on staleness thresholds

### Low Confidence (<50%)

- Long-term stability - insufficient data
- Generalizability - single context only
- Decision accuracy - no measurement
- User satisfaction - no survey data
- False positive rate - not tracked

## 📋 VERIFICATION PROTOCOL

For every statistic in the research paper:

1. **Source Required**: Every metric must reference a source file or command
2. **Reproducible**: Query/command must be documented for verification
3. **Timestamped**: Date of verification must be recorded
4. **Limitation Acknowledged**: What the metric does NOT measure must be stated

**Example**:
- ✅ GOOD: "Framework logged 1,266+ decisions (source: MongoDB query, verified 2025-10-25). Limitation: Activity ≠ accuracy; no measurement of decision correctness."
- ❌ BAD: "Framework makes thousands of good decisions"

---

## 🎯 CLAIMS CHECKLIST FOR WORKING PAPER

Before making any claim, verify:

- [ ] Is this supported by verifiable data? (Check metrics-verification.csv)
- [ ] Is the source documented and reproducible?
- [ ] Are limitations explicitly acknowledged?
- [ ] Does this avoid prohibited terms? (inst_016/017/018)
  - ❌ "production-ready"
  - ❌ "battle-tested"
  - ❌ "proven effective"
  - ✅ "demonstrated in development context"
  - ✅ "validation ongoing"
  - ✅ "preliminary evidence suggests"
- [ ] Is uncertainty estimated?
- [ ] Is scope clearly bounded? (development-time only, single context)

---

## 🚨 RED FLAGS

Reject any claim that:

1. **Lacks source**: No documented query/command
2. **Overgeneralizes**: Single context → all contexts
3. **Assumes causation**: Correlation without controlled testing
4. **Ignores limitations**: No acknowledgment of what's unmeasured
5. **Uses prohibited terms**: "production-ready", "proven", "guaranteed"
6. **Extrapolates without data**: Short timeline → long-term stability
