# Baseline Metrics Summary

**Date Collected**: 2025-10-25
**Purpose**: Source data for Working Paper v0.1 (Development-time governance)
**Session**: After all Phase 0 fixes complete
**Status**: VERIFIED - All issues resolved before baseline

---

## ✅ Phase 0 Fixes Completed

Before baseline collection, the following issues were resolved:

1. **Defense Layer 1**: Added missing credential patterns to .gitignore
2. **Defense Layer 5**: Created CREDENTIAL_ROTATION_PROCEDURES.md
3. **inst_083 Enforcement**: Updated audit-enforcement.js to recognize handoff auto-injection

**Result**: Clean baseline with 100% enforcement coverage and 100% defense-in-depth

---

## Enforcement Coverage

**Source**: `enforcement-coverage-baseline.txt` (scripts/audit-enforcement.js)

- **Total Imperative Instructions**: 40
- **Enforced**: 40 (100%)
- **Unenforced**: 0

**Verification**: All 40 HIGH-persistence MUST/NEVER/MANDATORY instructions have architectural enforcement mechanisms.

**Note**: This is enforcement coverage (hooks/scripts exist), NOT behavioral compliance (hooks work as intended).

## Framework Activity

**Source**: `framework-stats-baseline.txt` (scripts/framework-stats.js)

### Audit Logs
- **Total Decisions**: 1,204+ (growing during session)
- **Services Logging**: 6/6

### Service Breakdown
- ContextPressureMonitor: 600+ logs
- BoundaryEnforcer: 600+ logs  
- InstructionPersistenceClassifier: 8 logs
- CrossReferenceValidator: 6 logs
- MetacognitiveVerifier: 5 logs
- PluralisticDeliberationOrchestrator: 1 log

### Component Statistics
- **CrossReferenceValidator**: 1,858+ validations
- **BashCommandValidator**: 1,308+ validations, 162 blocks issued

---

## Defense-in-Depth Status

**Source**: `defense-layers-status.txt` (scripts/audit-defense-in-depth.js)

**Layers Complete**: 5/5 (100%)

- ✅ Layer 1: Prevention (.gitignore) - All patterns present
- ✅ Layer 2: Mitigation (Documentation redaction) - Active
- ✅ Layer 3: Detection (Pre-commit hook) - Active
- ✅ Layer 4: Backstop (GitHub secret scanning) - Available
- ✅ Layer 5: Recovery (Rotation procedures) - Documented

---

## Instructions Database

**Source**: framework-stats-baseline.txt

- **Total Instructions**: 82 (JSON file count)
- **Active Instructions**: 56 (synced to MongoDB)
- **Version**: 4.1
- **Last Updated**: 2025-10-25

### By Quadrant
- SYSTEM: 19
- STRATEGIC: 17
- OPERATIONAL: 17
- TACTICAL: 2
- rules: 1 (inst_075 - validation error, wrong quadrant value)

### By Persistence
- HIGH: 55
- MEDIUM: 1

## Session State

**Source**: framework-stats-baseline.txt

- **Session ID**: 2025-10-07-001 (legacy, not updated this session)
- **Context Pressure**: NORMAL (0%)
- **Dev Server**: Running on port 9000
- **MongoDB**: Connected to tractatus_dev

---

## Timeline Context

**Framework Development**: October 2025
**Deployment Context**: Single project (Tractatus website)
**Measurement Period**: Session-scoped data (not longitudinal)
**Baseline Date**: 2025-10-25 (after Phase 0 fixes)

---

## Verified Metrics for Research Paper

**Development-Time Governance (Working Paper v0.1 scope)**:

### Architectural Achievements
- ✅ 100% enforcement coverage (40/40 imperative instructions)
- ✅ 100% defense-in-depth (5/5 credential protection layers)
- ✅ 6/6 framework services operational
- ✅ 1,200+ governance decisions logged
- ✅ 162 real blocks issued (BashCommandValidator)

### What These Metrics Measure
- **Enforcement coverage**: Hooks/scripts exist for mandatory rules
- **Audit logs**: Framework activity recorded
- **Blocks issued**: Tool use prevented by validators

### What These Metrics Do NOT Measure
- Behavioral compliance (do hooks work?)
- Effectiveness (does this prevent governance fade?)
- Generalizability (works beyond this project?)
- Long-term stability (sustains over time?)

---

## Honest Limitations (For Research Paper)

1. **Timeline**: October 2025 only (<1 month)
2. **Context**: Single deployment (Tractatus website development)
3. **Scope**: Development-time governance only
4. **Measurement**: Architectural (hooks exist) not behavioral (hooks work)
5. **Validation**: Anecdotal observations, no systematic study
6. **Sample Size**: One project, one developer context

---

## For Working Paper v0.1

**Can Claim (with sources)**:
- Achieved 100% enforcement coverage (architectural)
- All 6 framework services operational and logging
- 162 blocks issued during development (real enforcement)
- Session lifecycle integration working (handoff auto-injection)

**Cannot Claim**:
- Proven effectiveness (no validation study)
- Behavioral compliance rates (not measured)
- Generalizability to other projects
- Long-term sustainability
- Solves governance fade (hypothesis only)
