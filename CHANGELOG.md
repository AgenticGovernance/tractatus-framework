  - Early observations from single deployment context (October 6-25, 2025)
  - Enforcement coverage progression: 28% â†’ 100% (5 waves)
  - Framework activity metrics: 1,294+ decisions, 162 blocks
  - Comprehensive limitations documentation
  - **Status**: Validation ongoing, NOT peer-reviewed

  - `examples/session-lifecycle/session-init-pattern.js` - Initialization pattern
  - `examples/audit/audit-logger.js` - Decision logging pattern
  - `patterns/rule-database/schema.json` - Rule database schema with examples

- **Documentation**
  - `README.md` - Complete project documentation with disclaimers
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines emphasizing honesty
  - `LICENSE` - Apache 2.0 license
  - `docs/limitations.md` - Comprehensive limitations documentation

### Important Notes

- This is **early research** from single deployment (19 days, one developer, one project)
- Findings are **observational only** - no controlled validation studies
- Code patterns are **generic examples** - not production-ready implementations
- Focus is **development-time governance** - runtime governance not evaluated

### Research Metrics Summary

- **Enforcement Coverage**: Progressed from 28% (11/39) to 100% (40/40) via 5-wave deployment
- **Framework Activity**: 1,294 governance decisions logged across 6 services
- **Real-World Blocks**: 162 bash commands blocked (12.2% block rate)
- **Timeline**: October 6-25, 2025 (19 days total)

### Limitations Acknowledged

**What We Can Claim**: Patterns demonstrated feasibility in single context

**What We Cannot Claim**:
- Long-term effectiveness (short timeline)
- Generalizability (single context only)
- Behavioral compliance validation (effectiveness unmeasured)
- Decision accuracy (correctness not validated)
- Production readiness (research patterns only)

See `docs/limitations.md` for comprehensive discussion.
